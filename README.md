# Unichat Application

This is a code repository for the Unichat application, a real time chat app using React, Firebase and React's Chat Engine. Using social auth, users can sign in with either Gmail or Facebook authentication. Once logged in, you can create a new chat room and invite anyone already registered. Other users can also invite you in to their own chatrooms which are all private by default.
